# JPMorgan Chase & Co. – Quantitative Research Virtual Experience (Forage)

This repository contains my work for the **JPMorgan Quantitative Research Virtual Experience Program** offered on **Forage**.

I am currently progressing through the 4-task simulation.  
So far, I have completed:

---

## ✅ Task 1: Investigate and Analyze Price Data
In this task, I worked on:

- Loading and cleaning natural gas monthly price data  
- Identifying seasonal patterns in commodity prices  
- Interpolating monthly data into daily estimates  
- Extrapolating future prices for an additional year  
- Building a Python function to estimate natural gas price for any given date  
- Visualizing price trends and seasonality  

All files related to Task 1 are inside the folder:

```
Task-1-Investigate-Price-Data/
```
