# JPMorgan Chase & Co. – Quantitative Research Virtual Experience (Forage)

This repository contains my work for the **JPMorgan Chase Quantitative Research Virtual Experience Program**, a job simulation from Forage that mirrors real quantitative research tasks at JPMorgan Chase & Co. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

I’m progressing through the 4-task simulation and documenting each task with code, visualizations, and results.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 🔹 Task 1 — Investigate and Analyze Price Data
In this task, I:
- Loaded and cleaned natural gas monthly price data
- Identified seasonal price patterns
- Interpolated monthly data into daily estimates
- Extrapolated future prices for one year
- Built a Python function to estimate price for any date
- Visualized trends and behavior

All files related to Task 1 are inside:  
`Task-1-Investigate-Price-Data/`  
(completed and documented)

### 🔹 Task 2 — Price a Commodity Storage Contract
In Task 2, I built a prototype pricing model for a natural gas storage contract that:
- Uses daily price estimates
- Computes buy/sell cash flows
- Accounts for injection, withdrawal, and storage costs
- Handles constraints like max volume and rates
- Outputs the **value of the contract** via a reusable function

Files for Task 2 are inside:  
`Task-2-Price-a-Commodity-Storage-Contract/`

## 🧠 In Progress

### ⚪ Task 3 — Credit Risk Analysis  
Building a predictive model to estimate **Probability of Default (PD)** based on borrower characteristics and calculate expected loss.  
(Work in progress)

### ⚪ Task 4 — Final Pricing Model  
Integrate Task 1–3 concepts into a full pricing framework.  
(Work in progress)
